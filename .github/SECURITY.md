# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We at Puroto are working hard to keep all parts of our site clean and secure. We are always only supporting the newest version in the `main` branch. Please note that we are only supporting official versions served at https://puroto.net, or one of it's sub-domains.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Thank you for helping us to improve the security for everyone on our platform! Security concerns and vulnerabilities shouldn't be reported using issues, but by sending an email with a close explanation of your concerns to [security@puroto.net](mailto:security@puroto.net?subject=Security). We'll investigate your report and try to get a fix out as soon as possible. Contributing a security fix is highly appreceated as well. Please send a report first over email and then you are free to open a PR at any time.
